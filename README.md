# Micro-organisms-image-classification

Microscopic creatures, like bacteria and tiny organisms, play big roles in science. In fields like health and technology, telling these small creatures apart using pictures is super important for finding diseases, making new medicines, and understanding the environment.

# Use Cases in Life Sciences and Biotechnology
Micro-organism image classification has various applications in the life sciences and biotechnology industries. It aids in:

Disease Identification : Assisting in identifying diseases caused by specific micro-organisms.

Drug Development : Supporting drug discovery by understanding the behavior of different micro-organisms and their response to drugs.

Environmental Studies : Facilitating environmental monitoring by identifying beneficial or harmful micro-organisms in different ecosystems.

Accurate classification of micro-organisms through deep learning models enhances research, diagnostics, and applications in these fields.
